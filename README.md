# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification App is typically be a machine learning application designed to predict the species of Iris flowers based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses the famous Iris dataset to train and test a classification model.

Key Features of the Iris Flower Classification App:
Input Data: Users would input the flower's measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Model Training: The app would use a classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict the species of the flower.
Prediction: After inputting the flower's measurements, the app would predict which species the flower belongs to (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
